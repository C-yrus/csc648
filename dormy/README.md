Clone it and do `cd dormy`

Then install the dependencies with `npm install`

Project structure and directories explanation:

`Controllers` - directory that holds all the controllers between routes and views

`Models` - directory that holds the models (User, Listing, etc)

`public` - directory that holds all the stylesheets, javascript files, and images (ALL STATIC FILES HERE)

`routes` - all URL definitions will be here

`views` - all UI files will be here, FRONTEND mainly

FRONTEND TEAM: I USED NUNJUCKS TEMPLATE ENGINE (https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)
